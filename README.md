# 🤖 Ethical AI Assessment Portfolio

This repository contains responses and deliverables for a comprehensive assessment on ethical AI development and governance. The work is organized into four graded parts and two bonus sections. Topics range from theoretical insights to code-based fairness audits using real-world datasets.

---

## 📘 Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (30%)

### ✅ Short Answer Questions
- Defined *algorithmic bias* with two concrete examples (e.g., hiring bias, facial recognition).
- Clarified the difference between *transparency* and *explainability* in AI.
- Analyzed the impact of the EU's GDPR on AI development, especially around data rights and accountability.

### ✅ Ethical Principles Matching
Matched core AI ethics principles (Justice, Non-maleficence, Autonomy, Sustainability) with their correct definitions.

## 📚 Part 2: Case Study Analysis (40%)

### Case 1: Biased Hiring Tool (Amazon)
- **Bias Source**: Skewed training data favoring male candidates.
- **Fixes Proposed**: Data rebalancing, fairness constraints, human oversight.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Disparate impact ratio, demographic parity, equal opportunity scores.

### Case 2: Facial Recognition in Policing
- **Ethical Risks**: Wrongful arrests, privacy violations, opacity.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Public oversight, human-in-the-loop enforcement, transparency, bias audits.

## 🧪 Part 3: Practical Audit (25%)

**Goal**: Audit the COMPAS Recidivism Dataset for racial bias using IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit.

### Deliverables
- Python notebook with logistic regression model and reweighing mitigation strategy.
- Visualization: False Positive Rates across racial groups.
- **300-word report** summarizing key findings, fairness issues, and mitigation strategies.
- Tools used: `aif360`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.

## 🧠 Part 4: Ethical Reflection (5%)

Reflected on personal project **Homework Ally** and how it adheres to ethical AI principles:
- Human-in-the-loop design
- Transparency in outputs
- Data privacy compliance (GDPR-aligned)
- Bias mitigation plans through diverse dataset testing
- Accessibility and inclusion practices

---

## 🎁 Bonus Task 1: Healthcare AI Policy Proposal (+10%)

Authored a **1-page policy guideline** for ethical AI use in healthcare including:
- **Patient Consent Protocols**: Opt-in models, consent renewals, data control, accessibility.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Diverse datasets, fairness audits, clinician oversight.
- **Transparency**: Explainable outputs, AI disclosure, version traceability, public safety reporting.
