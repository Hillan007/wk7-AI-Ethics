üß† 1. Short Answer Questions
Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.
Algorithmic bias is when an AI system produces results that are systematically prejudiced due to flawed assumptions, biased training data, or unequal model design.
Examples:
- Recruitment algorithms that favor male candidates because past training data reflects historical hiring biases.
- Credit scoring models that offer better loan conditions to certain demographics due to socioeconomic training data imbalances.

Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?
- Transparency refers to how open and clear developers are about how an AI system was built, what data it uses, and how it makes decisions.
- Explainability is the ability for people‚Äîespecially non-technical users‚Äîto understand the reasoning behind a specific AI decision.
Why both matter:
- Enable trust and accountability.
- Allow users and regulators to scrutinize systems.
- Help detect and fix bias or errors.
- Are essential for legal compliance, especially with regulations like GDPR.

Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?
GDPR shapes AI development by enforcing:
- Informed consent before using personal data.
- Data minimization‚Äîonly collecting what‚Äôs necessary.
- Right to explanation, where users can demand clarity on automated decisions.
- Right to erasure (‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù), letting users delete their data.
- Accountability mechanisms to document and prove responsible data handling.
This encourages developers to build AI systems with privacy by design and stronger human oversight.
